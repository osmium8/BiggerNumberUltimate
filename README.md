#### BiggerNumber Game

A simple Android app to demonstrate the use of Kotlin in Android development. The user is presented 2 numbers on buttons- depending on if the larger number was clicked, the background color will change.

Game, code, and logic inspired by Marty Stepp, instructor for Stanford's CS193A class.
